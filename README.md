# Mandelbrot
Mandelbrot generatro in full stack implementation using Go for the backend & Streamlit with pythonn for frontend.

# Mandelbrot Set in Go

This is a server-side implementation of the Mandelbrot set in the Go programming language. The server listens for HTTP requests and serves a PNG image of the Mandelbrot set when a particular route is accessed. The image is generated by iterating over each pixel in the image and computing the number of iterations it takes for the corresponding complex number to diverge, using the formula z = z^2 + c, where z and c are complex numbers.

The server also uses goroutines to parallelize the computation of the Mandelbrot set. Each goroutine is responsible for computing the colors of the pixels in a single row of the image.

# Getting Started

1. Install Go on your machine.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. In the root directory of the repository, run go build to build the executable.
4. Run the executable using :
```
go run main.go
```
The server responds to http request with the following parameters/

-iterations: the maximum number of iterations to use when computing the Mandelbrot set (default: 256)
-width: the width of the image in pixels (default: 512)
-height: the height of the image in pixels (default: 512)
-xmin: the lower bound of the real component of the complex plane to include in the image (default: -2)
-xmax: the upper bound of the real component of the complex plane to include in the image (default: 2)
-ymin: the lower bound of the imaginary component of the complex plane to include in the image (default: -2)
-ymax: the upper bound of the imaginary component of the complex plane to include in the image (default: 2)
For example, to generate an image with a width of 800 pixels, a height of 600 pixels, and a maximum of 512 iterations, you would visit http://localhost:8001/mandelbrot?width=800&height=600&iterations=512.
