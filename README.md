# Mandelbrot Set Generator

This is a web application for generating Mandelbrot sets and displaying them in a browser.

## Features

- Adjust the parameters of the Mandelbrot set using sliders in the sidebar menu 
- Generate the set and view the result in the main panel 
- See the generation time and the parameters used for the set

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or later
- Go 1.13 or later
- Streamlit 0.71 or later
- Requests 2.24 or later

## Backend

The server-side implementation of the Mandelbrot set is done in the Go programming language. The server listens for HTTP requests and serves a PNG image of the Mandelbrot set when a particular route is accessed. The image is generated by iterating over each pixel in the image and computing the number of iterations it takes for the corresponding complex number to diverge, using the formula z = z^2 + c, where z and c are complex numbers.

The server also uses goroutines to parallelize the computation of the Mandelbrot set. Each goroutine is responsible for computing the colors of the pixels in a single row of the image.

## Frontend
The frontend is written in python using the streamlit library. It enables you to set the required parameters in ergonomic way and enables you to make an HTTP request to the backend. It handles also the display of the generated set.

## Load balancing
 We are using goroutines to parallelize the computation of the Mandelbrot set. By dividing the image into pixels and assigning each worker a vertical line to compute, we can distribute the work more evenly across the workers, making better use of system resources. This approach can be effective if the amount of computation required for each pixel varies significantly, as it allows you to balance the workload more evenly.

In general, using goroutines can be a useful way to parallelize work in Go, as it allows you to concurrently execute multiple tasks without the overhead of creating and managing separate threads. 

## Getting Started

1. Install Go on your machine.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Install the required python dependacies by running this in the root of the repository :
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Start the server using :
```
go run main.go
```
The server responds to http request with the following parameters :

- **iterations** :   the maximum number of iterations to use when computing the Mandelbrot set (default: 256)
  
- **height** :       the height of the image in pixels (default: 512)
- **width** :        the width of the image in pixels (default: 512)
  
- **xmin** :         the lower bound of the real component of the complex plane to include in the image (default: -2)
- **xmax** :         the upper bound of the real component of the complex plane to include in the image (default: 2)
  
- **ymin** :         the lower bound of the imaginary component of the complex plane to include in the image (default: -2)
- **ymax** :         the upper bound of the imaginary component of the complex plane to include in the image (default: 2)
For example, to generate an image with a width of 800 pixels, a height of 600 pixels, and a maximum of 512 iterations, you would visit http://localhost:8001/mandelbrot?width=800&height=600&iterations=512.


5. In a separate terminal, start the frontend app:
```
streamlit run app.py
```
The app will open in your default web browser. Follow the instructions on the page to generate a Mandelbrot set.
