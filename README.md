# Mandelbrot Set Generator

This is a web application for generating Mandelbrot sets and displaying them in a browser.

## Features

Adjust the parameters of the Mandelbrot set using sliders in the sidebar menu
Generate the set and view the result in the main panel
See the generation time and the parameters used for the set

## Requirements

Python 3.6 or later
Go 1.13 or later
Streamlit 0.71 or later
Requests 2.24 or later

## Backend

This is a server-side implementation of the Mandelbrot set in the Go programming language. The server listens for HTTP requests and serves a PNG image of the Mandelbrot set when a particular route is accessed. The image is generated by iterating over each pixel in the image and computing the number of iterations it takes for the corresponding complex number to diverge, using the formula z = z^2 + c, where z and c are complex numbers.

The server also uses goroutines to parallelize the computation of the Mandelbrot set. Each goroutine is responsible for computing the colors of the pixels in a single row of the image.

## Frontend
The front end is written in python using the streamlit library
The web application for generating Mandelbrot sets and displaying them in a browser. The frontend is built with the Streamlit framework and the backend is written in Go.



## Architecture


### Getting Started

1. Install Go on your machine.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. In the root directory of the repository, run go build to build the executable.
4. Run the executable using :
```
go run main.go
```
The server responds to http request with the following parameters/

-iterations: the maximum number of iterations to use when computing the Mandelbrot set (default: 256)
-width: the width of the image in pixels (default: 512)
-height: the height of the image in pixels (default: 512)
-xmin: the lower bound of the real component of the complex plane to include in the image (default: -2)
-xmax: the upper bound of the real component of the complex plane to include in the image (default: 2)
-ymin: the lower bound of the imaginary component of the complex plane to include in the image (default: -2)
-ymax: the upper bound of the imaginary component of the complex plane to include in the image (default: 2)
For example, to generate an image with a width of 800 pixels, a height of 600 pixels, and a maximum of 512 iterations, you would visit http://localhost:8001/mandelbrot?width=800&height=600&iterations=512.



Usage

Clone this repository and navigate to the directory:
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mandelbrot-set-generator.git
cd mandelbrot-set-generator
Install the dependencies:
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Start the backend server:
Copy code
go run cmd/server/main.go
In a separate terminal, start the frontend app:
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
The app will open in your default web browser. Follow the instructions on the page to generate a Mandelbrot set.
